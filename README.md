## Description
            
This project is a full-stack Tech Blog application which follows the MVC (Model–view–controller) paradigm in its architectural structure. It uses Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

I built this application as a platform for people to discuss technology in a 'blog' style format. The collaborative nature of the application allows uses to engage in multiple threads of discussion which creates a community feeling. 

By completing this project, I now understand how to create a full stack application from scratch which has increased my confidence and expertise for other projects going forward. 

### Demonstration:

#### Video walkthrough:
To view a live demonstration of how the application works, [please watch this video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c32w35f-MP1BgwWfcTk4s8tSBrYJLgwf/view) which goes through the steps of signing up and adding, editing and deleting a post.

## Installation

To install this application, you'll need to clone the repository to your local machine. [Refer to this guide from GitHub if you need help.](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository/)

Once cloned, you will need to navigate to the project's folder in your terminal and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies: `npm install`.

Next, you will need PostgreSQL installed on your computer to initialise the database. [Visit PostgreSQL's website for links to download and installation instructions.](https://www.postgresql.org/)

            
## Usage

If you would like to host the application locally, follow the steps below:

Once all of the steps in [Installation](#installation) have been completed, you will firstly need to initialise the 'blog_db' database and seed data into it. To do so, enter the following commands once navigated to the project folder in your terminal:

1. `psql -U postgres` - This will start PostgreSQL. Enter your password if you set one up. 
2. `\i db/schema.sql` - To set up the 'employee_db' database. 
3. Close out of postgres by entering `Control + c`.

Next, seed the data by entering the following once navigated to the project folder in your terminal:

4. `node seeds/seed.js`

Then, you can run the server locally by entering the following:

5. `node server.js`.

6. If everything was installed and run correctly, you should be able to visit the application hosted locally on your machine by visiting: http://localhost:3001/
